  #
  # Note : A fresh Mysql 5.7 gets created with a random root password - which you can dig out of /var/log/mysqld.err
  # Seems the geerlingguy.mysql script is not taking this into account... The temporary password needs to be extracted
  # before the login attempt... not after as is scripted - so look into that later.
  #
  # Anyhow - the work around is to get the password from the error log, run mysql_secure_installation and
  # create /root/.my.cnf with user="root"\npassword="xxxx" - Re-script that into here when time permits.
